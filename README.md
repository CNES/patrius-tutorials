# PATRIUS Tutorials

This project contains a list of tutorials to learn how to use the PATRIUS library. These tutorials are compatible with **Patrius v4.12.1**, currently the latest version available on [Connect by CNES](https://www.connectbycnes.fr/patrius).

## ABOUT

PATRIUS is a core space dynamics Java library developed by the [CNES](http://cnes.fr), the French Space Agency, that enables developers to quickly develop high level algorithms such as orbit extrapolator. PATRIUS contains several sub-libraries that work together and cover low level classes (i.e.: such as matrix, vectors, orbits parameters) as well as high level classes and interfaces (i.e.: numerical propagators, attitude laws, manoeuvers sequences). 

All the main domains of space dynamics are available: 

  - Analysis, algebra and geometry core library (quaternions, derivable functions, integrators â€¦) 
  - Core objects for space dynamics (dates, orbits, frames...) 
  - Orbit propagation: analytical, semi-analytical and numerical propagators, a full set of force models 
  - Maneuvers: impulsive or continuous thrust, sequences 
  - Attitude: extensible set of attitude laws, sequences and guidance framework 
  - Events: event detection (orbital, sensor events, etc.) and post-processing (chronograms) 
  - Spacecraft: characteristics of mass, geometry (drag force), sensors field of view, etc. 

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

PATRIUS has its own Wiki accessible at the following address: http://patrius.cnes.fr

## Tutorial Description

This list of tutorials is divided in 10 themes:

  - attitude
  - dates
  - ephemeris
  - events
  - frames
  - maneuvers
  - miscellaneous
  - orbits
  - propagators
  - vehicle
  
All of which are located in the "src\main\java" folder.
